Nintendo 64	N64 Controller x2	PAL	SCN	Yes	No	No	One gray and one blue. I have replaced the analog sticks with new GC-style sticks that won't wear out like the original ones. They are however a bit shorter so the sensitivity is a bit higher than normal.

Wii	3rd Party Wii Nunchuck	??	??	Yes	Yes	Yes	Same as the above with the addition that it seems to make the IR pointer more laggy in homebrew apps for some reason.
Wii	3rd Party Wii Remote	??	??	Yes	Yes	Yes	Blue/Teal. Looks exactly like an official Wii remote, except for the fact that it doesn't say Nintendo or Wii. Instead, it's called WÃ¼. The buttons aren't as good as the original and the rumble feels weak and makes a lot more noise. The speaker is also often garbled. Otherwise works well.
